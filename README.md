## Usage
The Starter Repo provides a foundation for building web applications. Here are some important files and directories you should be aware of:

- **src/**: This directory contains the source code for your application. You can write your Express routes and logic in TypeScript files located here.

- **build/**: This directory is automatically generated when you compile your TypeScript code. The compiled JavaScript files will be placed here.

- **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the TypeScript compiler options and settings for your project. You can modify it as per your requirements.

Feel free to modify and extend the Starter Repo to suit your project needs.

## Scripts
The Starter Repo includes the following scripts that you can run using `npm run <script-name>` or `yarn <script-name>`:

- **dev**: Starts the development server using `ts-node-dev` to automatically recompile and reload your code when changes are detected.

- **start**: Runs the compiled JavaScript code located in the `build/` directory using Node.js.

- **tsc**: Compiles your TypeScript code and generates JavaScript files in the `build/` directory.

Feel free to modify or add more scripts to suit your project requirements. You can find these scripts in the `package.json` file.
